# Some Terminologies
1. **Agentless Platform**: Agentless security is a technique that secures networks and endpoints without the need for software agents. By leveraging existing infrastructure and protocols, agentless security provides a holistic view of the network, enabling better threat detection and response.

2. **ApexaiQ Score**: ApexaiQ risk score to measure and improve your security posture continuously on the scale of 60-180.

3. **Vulnerabilities**: Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or flaws in a system, whether in hardware or software, that can be exploited by attackers to compromise security.

4. **Obsolescence**: The process of becoming out of date, no longer in general use or no longer useful is known as Obsolescence.

5. **Compilance**: Compliance refers to the act of following laws, regulations, and guidelines that apply to a specific industry or organization.

6. **Maintenance**: Maintenance is the act of keeping something in good condition or providing support.

7. **End of Life/Support/Maintenance**: EOL software, or end-of-life software, refers to software no longer actively supported by the vendor, meaning it doesn't receive updates, bug fixes, or security patches.

8. **Asset Hygiene**: Asset Hygiene refers to the continuous process of maintaining the health, security and visibility of all hardware and software assets within an organization's IT environment.

9. **Crown Jewel**: It refers to an organization's most valuable and critical data, assets and systems. These are the assets that if compromised , would cause most significant damage to the business.

10. **Inventory**: In the world of Information Technology (IT) and cybersecurity, an inventory (often called an asset inventory) is a comprehensive and detailed list of all the organization's hardware and software assets. This is a foundational element of IT management and security.

11. **NVD**: The NVD(National Vulnerability Database) provides the essential intelligence that powers the tools and processes organizations use to protect their systems from known security threats.

12. **Patch Management**: Patch management is the process that companies use to manage and deploy software updates, known as patches, to their systems.

13. **Data Breaches**: A data breach is a security incident in which sensitive, protected, or confidential information is accessed, disclosed, or stolen by an unauthorized individual.

14. **MSP**: A Managed Service Provider (MSP) is a company that remotely manages a customer's IT infrastructure and/or end-user systems, typically on a proactive basis and under a subscription model.

15. **Device Types**: There are various different Device types like Desktops, Laptops, Tablets, Servers, Smartphones, etc. There are also different types like Peripheral, Storage, Network and IoT devices.

16. **True SaaS**: At its basic level, SaaS is a software delivery model where a third-party provider hosts an application and makes it available to customers over the internet. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via a web browser, and you typically pay a subscription fee.

17. **Inbound/Outbound Integration**: Inbound integration is when your system receives data or requests from an external, third-party system. Outbound integration is when your system sends data or requests to an external, third-party system.

18. **Compliance Standards**: A compliance standard** is a set of specific rules, procedures, and guidelines that an organization is required to follow.
      - **CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency):** This is **not a standard**. It's a United States federal agency responsible for improving cybersecurity and infrastructure protection across all levels of government and the private sector.
      - **CISO (Chief Information Security Officer)**: The CISO is the senior-level executive within an organization responsible for establishing and maintaining the company's security vision, strategy, and programs.
      - **HIPPA**: HIPPA(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)is US federal law that sets a national standard for protecting sensitive patient health information (PHI) from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge.
      - **ISO 27001**: This **is a compliance standard**. It's the leading international standard for managing information security.

19. **Perimeter**: The **perimeter** is the boundary or the total distance around the outside of a two-dimensional shape.

20. **ROI and KPI**: **ROI** measures the profitability of an investment, while a **KPI** measures the performance of a specific business objective.

21. **Auto-remediation**: Auto-remediation is the automatic resolution of a security threat or system issue without human intervention.

22. **Network protocols**: Network protocols are sets of rules that govern how data is exchanged between devices on a network.
      - **Internet Protocol (IP)**: **IP** is the principal protocol for routing traffic across the internet. Its main job is to handle the addressing of devices.
      - **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: TCP works hand-in-hand with IP. Its primary role is to ensure the **reliable, ordered, and error-checked** delivery of data.
      - **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**: UDP is another protocol that **works with IP**, but it's much simpler and faster than TCP.
      - **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**: It adds a layer of encryption using **SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security).
23. **Due-Dilignce**: Due diligence is the process of conducting reasonable **research and investigation** before entering into an agreement or a financial transaction with another party.

24. **SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation and Response)**: SOAR stands for **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response**.
      - **Alert:** An email security tool detects a potential phishing email and sends an alert.
      - **Orchestration:** The SOAR platform receives the alert and pulls in related information from other tools. It checks the sender's reputation from a threat intelligence feed, examines the email attachment in a sandbox, and scans the suspicious link with a URL analysis tool.
      - **Automation:** Based on its playbook, the SOAR platform automatically performs several actions:
         - It searches all employee inboxes for similar emails and deletes them.
         - It blocks the sender's IP address on the firewall.
         - It adds the malicious link to a blocklist.
      - **Response:** The SOAR platform creates an incident ticket, logs all the automated actions, and presents a complete report to the security analyst. The analyst can then quickly verify the actions, add notes, and officially close the incident.
       
25. **Role of ITAM in Zero Trust Security Models**: That's an excellent and very relevant question. The role of **IT Asset Management (ITAM)** is not just important in a Zero Trust security model—it's absolutely foundational.

26. **Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM)**: CAASM is an emerging approach in cybersecurity that helps organizations see and manage their entire collection of digital assets to identify security gaps and reduce their attack surface.

27. **Accelerator**: An accelerator is a tool, framework, or pre-written code component that helps developers build software faster. Its main purpose is to handle common, repetitive tasks so that developers can focus on writing unique, high-value business logic.

28. **Audits**: An audit is a systematic and independent examination of a company's books, accounts, records, or systems to ascertain how far they comply with established standards, rules, or laws.

29. **Crawl job**: A crawl job is a task given to an automated program, called a crawler or spider, to systematically browse and index content on the internet or within a specific network.

30. **MDM (Master Data Management)**: Master Data Management solves this by creating a central hub that cleans, standardizes, and syncs this master data across the entire organization, ensuring everyone is working from the same, accurate information.
